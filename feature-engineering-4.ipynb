    "Ordinal Encoding is a technique where the categories of a categorical variable are assigned an ordered numerical value based on their rank or position.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a variable \"education level\" with categories \"High School\", \"College\", and \"Graduate School\", we can assign them values 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This technique assumes an inherent order or hierarchy in the categories and is useful when the categories have a clear ordering, such as in the case of education level, where \"Graduate School\" is higher than \"College\", which in turn is higher than \"High School\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding, on the other hand, is a technique where each category of a categorical variable is assigned a unique numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a variable \"color\" with categories \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\", we can assign them values 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This technique does not assume any order or hierarchy in the categories and is useful when the categories do not have an inherent order.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example where we might choose one over the other is when encoding the categorical variable \"size\" with categories \"Small\", \"Medium\", and \"Large\". If we believe that the size categories have a clear ordering, such as \"Small\" being smaller than \"Medium\" and \"Medium\" being smaller than \"Large\", we might choose to use Ordinal Encoding. On the other hand, if we believe that the size categories do not have an inherent order, such as \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\" in the \"color\" example, we might choose to use Label Encoding."

    "Covariance is a measure of the extent to which two random variables are linearly related. Specifically, it measures the degree to which the values of one variable change in relation to the values of another variable. If two variables have a positive covariance, it means that when one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well. If they have a negative covariance, it means that when one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. If the covariance is zero, it means that the variables are not linearly related.\n",

For example, in finance, covariance is used to measure the degree to which the returns on two different stocks are related, which can help investors diversify their portfolios.\n",
